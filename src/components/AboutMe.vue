  <p>I believe we're living in the most exciting time for technology. The opportunities and challenges we face now are going to be solved by developers. I am a junior/mid-level Full-Stack Web Developer with a particular knack for (and love of) Back-End development. I take pride in combining my Node.js and database (SQL or NoSQL) skills to develop apps with the highest standards of security, stability and scalability. But when I'm not geeking out over dev tech, you can catch me geeking out over Hi-Fi audio, or spending a day at my favorite place on earth - a tennis court.</p>
